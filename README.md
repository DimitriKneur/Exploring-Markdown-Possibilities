# Exploring-Markdown-Possibilities

Discover here some tips to help you enhance your markdown files.

Let's go !

## Add titles and subtitles

You can transform a text into a title / subtitle simply by adding # before it.

Let's take an example. If you write into your markdown :
```
# Amazing Title 1
## Tremendous Title 2
### Breathtaking Title 3
```
Here is what will be displayed :
# Amazing Title 1
## Tremendous Title 2
### Breathtaking Title 3
<br>

As you can see, the more # you add, the lower your element will be in the title hierarchy.
