# Exploring-Markdown-Possibilities

Discover here some tips to help you enhance your markdown files.

Let's go !

## Add titles and subtitles

You can transform a text into a title / subtitle simply by adding # before it.

Let's take an example. If you write into your markdown :
```
# Amazing Title 1
## Tremendous Title 2
### Breathtaking Title 3
```
<br>

As you can see, the more # you add, the lower your element will be in the title hierarchy.

## Stylize your text

| Style |   Syntax   |    Example   |    Output   |
|--------------|------------|--------------|-------------|
| Bold | `** **` or `__ __` | `__Bold text__` | **Bold text** |
|    Italic   | `* *` or `_ _` | `*Italic text*` | *Italic text* |
|Strikethrough   | `~~ ~~` | `~~Mistake~~`| ~~Mistake~~ |
|Bold and nested italic | `** **` and `_ _` | `**I have an _urgent_ notice !**`| **I have an _urgent_ notice !** |
